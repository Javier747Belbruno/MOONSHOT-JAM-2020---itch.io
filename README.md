# MOONSHOT-JAM-2020---itch.io

Game Off is an annual game jam, where participants spend the month of November creating games based on a secret theme. Participate individually, or as a team. Use whatever game engines, libraries, and languages you like.

The theme for this year’s Game Off is MOONSHOT.

moonshot thinking – noun

a type of thinking that aims to achieve something that is generally believed to be impossible.
Use “moonshot thinking” and interpret the theme however you like. 

Let your imagination run wild and create a game loosely based or inspired by the Moonshot theme using whatever game engines, libraries or languages you prefer before December 1, 13:37 PT. Work alone or as a team. Most importantly, have fun!
